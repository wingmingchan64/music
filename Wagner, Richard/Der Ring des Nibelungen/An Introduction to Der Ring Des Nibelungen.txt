Derycke Cooke: An Introduction to Der Ring Des Nibelungen

https://hendrikslegtenhorst.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/intro.pdf

〚1〛Of all great musical compositions Der Ring des Nibelungen is by far the
largest: a consecutive performance of its four separate parts would last for some fifteen hours. To confer unity on this vast scheme Wagner built his score out of a number of recurrent themes, each one associated with some element in the drama and developed in conjunction with that element throughout the work. 

These themes — or leading motives as they have come to be called are not mere identification tags; nor is the score a simple patchwork made up by introducing each motive at the appropriate point in the stage-action. Wagner’s own description of his themes was ‘melodic moments of feeling’, and writing about his intentions beforehand he said: ‘these melodic moments will be made by the orchestra into a kind of emotional guide throughout the labyrinthine structure of the drama’. Wagner’s motives have, in reality, a fundamentally psychological significance, and his score is a continuous symphonic development of them, reflecting the continuous psychological development of the stage action.

In consequence, a comprehensive analysis of The Ring would be an enormous
task. It would involve clarifying the psychological implications of all the motives, and tracing their changing significance throughout the whole of their long and complex development. Nevertheless, understanding and enjoyment of the work can be greatly helped by simply establishing the identity of all the really important motives, and indicating what immediate dramatic symbols they stand for which is all that this introduction is intended to do. The motives are associated with four different types of dramatic symbol: characters, objects, events, and emotions. An example of a motive representing a character is the stern fanfare which introduces Hunding in Act One of Die Walküre.

An example of a motive representing an object is the genial theme associated with Freia’s Golden Apples. This is introduced in Scene Two of Das Rhinegold; it is sung by Fafner as he explains the value of the apples to Fasolt.

EX. 2: GOLDEN APPLES

An example of a motive representing an event is the brief, agitated figure on the woodwind which follows Alberich’s Threat of violence against the Rhinemaidens in Scene One of Rhinegold.

EX. 3: ALBERICH’S THREAT

An example of a motive representing an emotion is the furious repeated figure on the orchestra which portrays Siegfried’s anger during Act One of Siegfried.

EX. 4: SIEGFRIED’S ANGER

These examples are only four of the almost innumerable motives in The Ring. But
at the heart of this diversity there is a simple unity: practically all the motives arise from a few basic motives. Each of these basic motives represents one of the central symbols of the drama; and it generates a number of other motives, by a process of transformation, to represent various aspects of the central symbol concerned. And so we can thread our way through the jungle of  motives in The Ring by grouping them into their different families. We can start from each basic motive in turn, and trace the family of motives it generates throughout The Ring, before continuing with the next basic motive.
