Matthew Lien: Bressanone

Here I stand in Bressanone
With the stars up in the sky
Are they shining over Brenner
And upon the other side
You would be a sweet surrender
But I must go the other way
And my train will carry me onward
Though my heart would surely stay
Oh my heart would surely stay...

Now the clouds are flying by me
And the moon is on the rise
I have left the stars behind me
They were diamonds in your skies
You would be a sweet surrender
But I must go the other way
And my train will carry me onward
Though my heart would surely stay
Oh my heart would surely stay...
