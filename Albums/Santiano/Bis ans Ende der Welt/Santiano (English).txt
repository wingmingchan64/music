[Verse 1]
Farewell now, my love, send me off with a kiss
Heave away, straight ahead, Santiano
The tears are as salty and deep as the sea
But my sailor's heart is keen to go

[Chorus]
As far the wind in our sails may blow
Heave away, straight ahead, Santiano
Bright the day and the heavens know
We'll be kings wherever we may go

[Verse 2]
Hoist every bit of sail, bring us to full speed
Heave away, straight ahead, Santiano
Who knows what our fate may be
But the whole wide world is ours to see

[Chorus]
As far the wind in our sails may blow
Heave away, straight ahead, Santiano
Bright the day and the heavens know
We'll be kings wherever we may go

[Verse 3]
I'm fine without a roof and a house of stone
Heave away, straight ahead, Santiano
Home for me is the sea we roam
And the roof of stars is mine alone (Hey)

[Chorus]
As far the wind in our sails may blow
Heave away, straight ahead, Santiano
Bright the day and the heavens know
We'll be kings wherever we may go

[Verse 4]
Farewell now, my love, send me off with a kiss
Heave away, straight ahead, Santiano
The tears are as salty and deep as the sea
But my sailor's heart is keen to go

[Chorus]
As far the wind in our sails may blow
Heave away, straight ahead, Santiano
Bright the day and the heavens know
We'll be kings wherever we may go

[Chorus]
As far the wind in our sails may blow
Heave away, straight ahead, Santiano (Santiano!)
Bright the day and the heavens know
We'll be kings wherever we may go
